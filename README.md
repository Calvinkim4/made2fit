### Description
Problem Statement - 


Here are the requirements: 

##### A front-end that consumes your own API
- Permit the user to perform Index, Show, Create, Update, and Delete actions whether or not they are logged in (unless it makes sense for that information to be restricted to particular users).
- Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS. Remember to use Grid and Flexbox!
- Use React Router for client side routing.
